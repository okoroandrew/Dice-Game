have the same functionality.
● Both players will start with a counter of 10.
● Each player will have a particular die during the entire game.
● Both players will roll their corresponding die (once per round).
● The values of the dice will be compared to determine who wins the round. The player
with the highest value wins the round.
● If the two values are equal, then there is a tie and there is no winner for that round. The
counters are not modified.
● The counter of the player who wins a round will be decremented by 1.
● The counter of the player who loses a round will be incremented by 1.
